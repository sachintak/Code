# Module is something in which we can use someone else written code, we just need to import that module in our code 
import time # example - imported time module
time.sleep(5) # this is function in this module 
print("5 Seconds have passed since this program ran") # this statment will print after 5 sec of execution of this program


# Pip - it is package manager for python (package - django, flask etc.)

#There are two types of modules 
# 1. Build-in modules - pre installed in python  
# 2. External modules  - need to install using pip - we cannot simply import these modules

# import external module 
# pip install < module_name > 
# example -  pip install flask  (run this command on cmd)

#### import flask 

# Now there will be no error related to module import 
# for module import error check-out -> external-module-import-error.png

                            
#                              REPL - Read Evaluate Print Loop 

# Where we directly excute our code on terminal (powershell,bash,cmd) by simply typing - 'python' 
# It will execute every single line we type on terminal 
# REPL - example - REPL.png
